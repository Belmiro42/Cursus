		VIRTUAL MACHINES
		1. WHAT IS A VIRTUAL MACHINE
		2. HOW DOES A VIRTUAL MACHINE WORK
		3. THE PURPOSE OF VIRTUAL MACHINES [¹]
									A virtual machine is software that uses software instead of a physical
									computer to run programs and apps. There are guest machines on host machines.
									While host machines are limited by their physicality, eg, a host machone 
									might be limited by physical RAM, however guest machines can share and
									distribute resources often making them optimal for certain tasks. Each VM runs
									its own operating system. 
									
									At the moment operating VMs on the cloud is all the rage, meaning you can 
									provide different functions with less computing and more flexibility and at
									a lower cost. Possible uses are to test applications in a closed environment 
									where it cant affect data or processes on a host computer.
									
									Advantages:
									- Can run multiple OSs on the same computer
									- Integration with legacy systems
									- Disaster recovery
									- Application Provision options
									
									Disadvantages
									- Running multiplle OSs on the same system environments means you need to 
									balance resources
									- Less efficient than a computer and so use a mix of physical and virtual
									infrastructure
									
									Two Types of Virtual Machines
									1. Process Virtual Machine - Apllications that make platform independent 
									programming environments
									2. System Virtual Machine - A fully realised copy of a virtual machine with 
									an OS
									
									Five Types of Virtual Machines
									1. Hardware Virt. Big machine that is a fat OS or series of OSs, communicates
									directly with physical resources. 
									2. Software Virt. Software being hosted within other host systems.
									3. Storage Virt. Multiple storage units united by a virtual machine
									4. Network Virt. A single device acting as a network
									5. Desktop Virt. Make a remote desktop
										
		THE CHOICE OF OPERATING SYSTEM ROCKY VS DEBIAN
		SELinux vs APPARMOR
		YUM X DNF VS APT
									
									Rocky OS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
									Compatability with RHEL. The similarities between Rocky and RHEL mena that you 
									can get acquainted with the system before paying for it.
									
									SELinux 
									Both Rocky and Debian support SELinux but Rocky integrates it more closely
									Other dependencies are available which enhance the Rocky SELinux experience
									SELinux grants privileges based on  file labels whereas	AppArmor grants 
									privileges based on file path I cant lie they identification of what privileges 
									to grant is basically the  same basically the same.  However the foundations 
									theyre built upon are slightly different. AppArmor collects log data and analyses
									programs and port activity. Whereas SELinux has a reverse log where it logs what
									they do, subjects, objects (without activity judgement) a server which makes
									decisions  etc. Modes are also different where AppArmor can only log violations
									and enforce policy. While SELinux can also enforce, it can also be disabled and
									passive, it will log everything, not just violations and wont deny them.[³]
									
									
									yum dnf vs apt
									yum & dnf allow good version control for dependencies, they also have faster 
									releases for their packages meaning access to better software [²]
							
														
		APPTITUDE VS APT					These are both package managers.
									Apt offers a command line interface while aptitude offers a visual interface
									
									when facing a problem apt will just stop while aptitude will attempt to offer 
									advice on how to resolve the problem. [⁴]
													
		UFW STARTED						#####> sudo ufw status
		SSH STARTED						#####> sudo service ssh status
		DEBIAN STARTED						#####> uname -v		
									
		
	USER
		CHECK GROUPS OF USER					#####> getent group sudo / user42
		CREATE A NEW USER¡					#####> sudo adduser (user)			
		CREATE A NEW PASS FOLLOWING PASS POLICY			1M 1m 1n (!xxx) (!user)	
		
		
		EXPLAIN HOW THEY SET UP PASSWORD RULES ON VM		install a module called pam_pwquality and then modifying it here
									#####> nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
		CREATE "EVALUATING" GROUP				#####> sudo addgroup evaluating					
		ASSIGN TO NEW USER					#####> sudo adduser (user) evaluating
		CHECK NEW USER IN EVALUATIng				#####> getent group evaluating
									
		ADVANTAGES OF THE PASSWORD POLICY [⁵]
									Protects data - especially if working with privileged data
									Identity Theft
															
		
	HOSTNAME + PARTITIONS
		HOSTNAME IS BMATOS-D4					#####> hostname
		MODIFY HOSTNAME AND REPLACE W YOURS			#####> sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>
		
		RESTART MACHINE						
										
		RESTORE MACHINE TO ORIGINAL HOSTNAME			#####> sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>				
		HOW TO VIEW PARTITIONS					#####> lsblk
		
		COMPARE TO THE PARTITIONS EXAMPLE IN THE SUBJECT
									
		HOW LVM WORKS[⁶]					Linux logical volume manager
									Allows for dynamic volume resizing
									Being able to add space annd physical drives without downtime
									Consistent backups by taking snapshots of the volume
																
	
	SUDO
		CHECK SUDO IS INSTALLED					#####> sudo -V (which sudo) (dpkg -s sudo)
		ASSIGN EVALUATOR USER TO SUDO				#####> sudo adduser (user) sudo
									
		WHY USE SUDO[⁷]						efficient way to temporary grant root access	
									
		RULES FOR SUDO AND HOW TO IMPOSE THEM 			/etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
									requiretty ->require a privileged session to use sudo
									
		VERIFY /VAR/LOG/SUDO EXISTS AND HAS <= ONE FILE		#####> cd /var/log/sudo
		CHECK CONTENTS OF THE LOG FILE				#####> cd & cat
									
		WHICH FILES CHANGE WHEN SUDO COMMAND RAN
									cat /var/log/sudo
									
	UFW / FIREWALLD
		CHECK UFW IS PROPERLY INSTALLED				#####> ufw -v (which ufw) (dpkg -s ufw)			
		CHECK IT WORKS PROPERLY					#####> sudo service ufw status
									#####> sudo ufw allow 8080
									#####> sudo ufw status numbered	
									#####> sudo ufw delete num_rule
									#####> sudo systemctl enable ssh	// sudo systemctl start ssh
									#####> sudo systemctl stop ssh 		// sudo systemctl disable ssh							
									
		WHAT IS UFW DOING [⁸]					FIREWALL BABY, check 

									
	SSH
		CHECK SSH INSTALLED					#####> which shh 
		CHECK ITS WORKING					#####> sudo service ssh status
									
		WHAT IS SSH AND WHAT IS THE VALUE
											
		VERIFY SSH ONLY USES PORT 4242				For this part we open /etc/ssh/sshd_config etc.
									
		USE SSH TO LOG IN WITH A NEW USER			
		FORBIDDEN TO USE SSH WITH ROOT USER
									
									
	
	SCRIPT MONITORING
		HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS					REVISE GUIDE
									
		WHAT IS CRON
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron							
									
		10 MINS EXP
		RUN EVERY MINUTE					#####> CHANGE 10 TO 1				
		MAKE THE SCRIPT STOP 					#####> sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop / start
		
		RESTART SERVER	
		
		CHECK SCRIPT STILL EXISTS				#####> sudo crontab -u root -e	
		PERMISSIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED				#####> ls -la
